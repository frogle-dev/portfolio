    "### Changes to UFO movement:\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we modified the movement of the UFO. We thought that the previous movement was sort of repetetive. So, we decided to add horizontal movement on top of the vertical oscillation. \n",
    "Our first iteration consisted of making the UFO move horizontally with the same function as vertically. This created a sort of diagonal oscillation effect.\n",
    "Next, we tried changing the strength and speeds of each movement to vary it more.\n",
    "Finally, we settled on changing the function of the horizontal movement to a tangent function. This created a cool effect of the UFO teleporting from one side of the screen to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here was our code for this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Player extends GameObject {\n",
    "\tconstructor(image, gameWorld) {\n",
    "\tconst width = image.naturalWidth / 2;\n",
    "\tconst height = image.naturalHeight / 2;\n",
    "\tconst x = (gameWorld.width - width) / 2;\n",
    "\tconst y = (gameWorld.height - height) / 2;\n",
    "\tsuper(image, width, height, x, y);\n",
    "\tthis.baseY = y;\n",
    "\tthis.baseX = x;\n",
    "\tthis.frame = 0;\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "\tupdate() {\n",
    "\tcanvas.onkeydown = function(evt) {\n",
    "\t\tchangeDir(evt.keyCode);\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "\n",
    "\tthis.x = this.baseX + Math.tan(this.frame * 0.1) * 40;\n",
    "\tthis.y = this.baseY + Math.sin(this.frame * 0.05) * 20;\n",
    "\tthis.frame++;\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The line we specifically changed was this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "this.x = this.baseX + Math.tan(this.frame * 0.1) * 40;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Essentially, this takes the UFO's x position and offsets it by the tangent function. This function takes in the current frame as input in order to make it move as the time progresses. Then, the \"* 0.1\" is used to slow down its movement and the \"* 40\" is used to expand the distance it covers.\n",

    "### Background image change\n",

    "We also decided to change the background image of the page. We decided to use a stock image with watermarks because it looked kind of funny. \n",
    "In order to do this we had to import a new image into the repository and change the path within the background.md to utilize the new image.\n",
