    "We work together in groups of three to plan, design, test, and imporve the pre version of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1 – Evaluate the Game\n",
    "Play the current Cookie Clicker version to understand what features already exist, how cookies accumulate, and what feels missing or repetitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2 – Brainstorm New Ideas\n",
    "We discussed ideas that would make the cookie clicker game much better and a cleaner experience for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3 – Define Your Feature\n",
    "See flowchart below for current workflow example. Decide on your chosen feature and write a clear one-sentence description of what it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4 – Design & Implement\n",
    "We decided that we should add a restart button as if people would want to restart it would be there. We also added some more upgrades, and auto clickers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5 – Save with localStorage\n",
    "If your feature should persist after refreshing, integrate **localStorage** to save its state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6 – Test and Refine\n",
    "Run the game to check if your feature works as expected. Fix any issues, refine the design, and polish the user experience. Once everything is finalized, add your feature to the mermaid chart.\n",

    "- Add more to the shop\n",
    "- Add more to the upgrades\n",
    "- Add a Cookies per second counter\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Ideas\n",
    "- New Shop Item: e.g., an upgrade that costs cookies and increases click power.\n",
    "- Superpower: e.g., a button that gives a burst of cookies but only if you have enough to activate it.\n",
    "- Unlockable: a special item that only appears after reaching a certain number of cookies.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Steps to Add Your Feature\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decide on your feature idea and describe it in one sentence.\n",
    "2. Add any new buttons or text if your feature needs them.\n",
    "3. Write a **function** that makes the feature work.\n",
    "4. Use an **if statement** so the feature only works under the right conditions.\n",
    "5. Use **localStorage** to save the state of your feature if needed.\n",

    "# OOP Lesson\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve already learned how to add new **features** with functions, if statements, and localStorage. Now let’s take it a step further and learn about **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP stands for **Object-Oriented Programming**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a way of coding where you think about things in your program as **objects**.  \n",
    "- An **object** is like a “thing” that has **properties** (data) and **methods** (actions it can do).  \n",
    "- A **class** is like a blueprint or recipe to make those objects.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Think about the real world:  \n",
    "- A **cookie** is an object (it has a size, a flavor, a number).  \n",
    "- A **shop item** is an object (it has a cost, a name, and something it does).  \n",
    "- A **player** is also an object (they have cookies, upgrades, and power).  \n",
    "\n",
    "With OOP, instead of writing lots of separate functions and variables, we **bundle them together** so they belong to one object.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why OOP in Cookie Clicker?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cookie Clicker is a great example of OOP because almost everything in the game can be thought of as an object:  \n",
    "- The **cookie** object keeps track of how many cookies you have.  \n",
    "- The **upgrade** objects know their cost, effect, and how many you own.  \n",
    "- The **shop** can be an object that manages all the upgrades.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This makes the game easier to build, easier to add new features, and much more organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## OOP Concepts in Cookie Clicker\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class** → A blueprint. Example: `Upgrade` describes what all upgrades should have.  \n",
    "- **Object (Instance)** → A real thing you can use. Example: “Golden Cursor Upgrade” created from the `Upgrade` class.  \n",
    "- **Properties (Attributes)** → Variables that belong to an object. Example: `cost`, `multiplier`, `owned`.  \n",
    "- **Methods** → Functions that belong to an object. Example: `buy()` checks cost and applies the upgrade.  \n",
    "- **Encapsulation** → Each object manages its own data and actions. You don’t need to rewrite `buy()` for every single upgrade.  \n",
    "- **Persistence with localStorage** → Save and load objects so your upgrades stay after refreshing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Student Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make an `Upgrade` class for shop items.  \n",
    "2. Give it properties like `name`, `cost`, `multiplier`, and `owned`.  \n",
    "3. Add a `buy()` method that uses an **if statement** to check if you have enough cookies.  \n",
    "4. Create at least **two objects** (like “Metal Spoon” and “Golden Cursor”) from the class.  \n",
    "5. Save and load these objects with **localStorage**.\n",
